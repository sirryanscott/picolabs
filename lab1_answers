1. Create new channel and send event. Do you get the same result on both? Yes, each channel must use the same ruleset on the pico.

2. Delete and resend. What happens? Get this error: {"error":"ECI not found: 8Psw5hnwkPgD8V5V5Zrv9i"}. The channel wasn't found and so the request couldn't be processed

3. Send the misspelled event. What happens? Empty directives are returned. Because the 'ecco' could not be found it could not process the request, resulting in an empty response.
